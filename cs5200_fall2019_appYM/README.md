# Final Project for CS5200

A website for reviewing restaurants, using data from the Yelp Fusion API, complete with 3 user types:

* Owner
* Customer
* Admin

In this project, the owner can create restaurants. Customer can favorite restaurants and admin can delete other users as well as create and delete restaurants. All users are able to update their profiles. There are endorse and follow in the initial design but I do not have time to debug for them :(

The database service is local MongoDB. I use the localhost database to store the information and the connection info can be found in cs5200_fall2019_appYM/RestoFinder/data/db.js, please change the localhost address and the schema. And is listened at port 5105 on my laptop.
